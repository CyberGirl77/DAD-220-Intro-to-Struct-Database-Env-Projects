# DAD-220-Intro-to-Struct-Database-Env-Projects
SQL and database projects completed in my DAD-220 Introduction to Structured Database Environments course. This work demonstrates how to design relational databases, implement processing functionality, and analyze data through SQL queries. These skills directly support cybersecurity by ensuring data integrity, enabling secure data management, and providing structured query techniques for identifying risks, anomalies, and compliance issues.
